I inputted my codes and a little report. I don't know if my validation or explanation is enough, i looked online for the past 
couple of days. If you need me to add more or change something, please let me know.

-The GolfBall3.java code inputs dimples into the code

-The GolfBall2.java code now includes the z-direction, breaking apart the code into components

-The GolfBall4.java code is the final result with dimples, z-direction and works to optimize spin for a desired distance

-To run any of the codes and get any of the graphs, first check if the boolean expression at the start of the code is true

-Open the command prompt and run javac GolfBall[2,3,4].java

-Wait for it to compile and then run java GolfBall[2,3,4]
